                <h3 class="red">Scientific Name:</h3>
                <p>Cosmicus Snakakus (from the Latin "cosmicus" meaning "of the cosmos" and "snakakus" meaning "serpentine friend"). This nomenclature reflects its mysterious otherworldly origins and its deceptively friendly demeanor.</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
<p>Various passerbys in the early 2020s, though some argue it has always been here, watching and waiting. Initial sightings were dismissed as optical illusions or elaborate pranks until multiple independent witnesses came forward with eerily similar descriptions.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>None of note (Mark Zuckerberg?). Taxonomists remain baffled by its classification, as it shares characteristics with reptiles but demonstrates behaviors that suggest a silicon-based life form. Some researchers have nicknamed its family "Technoserpentia" though this remains unofficial.</p>

            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Grassy plains, particularly those with sparse vegetation and open sky views. It seems drawn to areas where the boundary between natural and digital worlds feels thin. Occasionally spotted near abandoned orchards and old tool sheds, giving credence to its peculiar preferences.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Seemingly normal but secretly very judgemental. At first glance, it appears as an ordinary serpent, but prolonged observation reveals an unsettling intelligence behind those unblinking white eyes. Its black form seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, and witnesses report feeling evaluated, as if being silently critiqued for their life choices.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Black in appearance with a matte finish that seems to defy natural lighting</li>
                    <li>Small white eyes that don't blink, maintaining perpetual eye contact</li>
                    <li>Signature winding movement that follows mathematical patterns</li>
                    <li>Fond of the third dimension and occasionally attempts to navigate a fourth</li>
                    <li>Exhibits unusual dietary discrimination between fruits and tools</li>
                    <li>Communicates through subtle shifts in trajectory and speed</li>
                </ul>

                The Snake Friend displays a peculiar affinity for apples, approaching them with what can only be described as enthusiasm (if snakes could be enthusiastic). Conversely, it harbors an inexplicable aversion to hammers, recoiling from them with visible distress. Researchers theorize this may be related to an ancient myth or perhaps a traumatic encounter with construction equipment. Several witnesses report seeing it "fold" into impossible angles. The creature appears most active during twilight hours and responds to both visual and tactile stimuli, though auditory signals seem to have no effect whatsoever.
                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> Take your state-provided apple and/or hammer and present it to the creature from a safe distance of approximately 3 meters. If you choose the right one (hint: it's the apple), the Snake Friend may approach slowly, moving in its characteristic winding pattern. It may even allow brief observation. Choose wrong, however, and the creature will retreat immediately, possibly phasing through nearby objects in its haste to escape. Warning: Do NOT attempt to touch the Snake Friend without proper authorization. Do NOT bring both items simultaneously, as this creates cognitive dissonance in the creature. Do NOT blink for extended periods while maintaining eye contact, as it interprets this as a challenge. Remember: the Snake Friend is always judging you, so bring your best behavior along with that apple.
